# Multiple_Linear-Regressor
This is based on simple linear regressor on multiple items inthe dataset
for simple regressor we use the formula called,y=b0+b1*x1
but for yhe multiple linear regressor we extend the formula by,y=b0+b1*x1+b2*x2+b3*x3+...+bn*xn
We use this by usage of the simple backward elimiination of the Significant errors and it is smaller to bigger to approach.
